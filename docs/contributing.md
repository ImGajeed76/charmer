# Contributing to Charmer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Charmer! This document provides guidelines and information for
contributors who want to help improve this Go-based TUI generator.

## üí≠ A Note from the Creator

Hey there! I'm ImGajeed76, the creator of Charmer. I want to be upfront with you: I'm not perfect, and neither is this
code. Like any developer, I make mistakes, and there's always room for improvement in the codebase. I believe in
continuous learning and getting better with each iteration.

If you find issues, have suggestions for better implementations, or see ways to improve the code structure - please
don't hesitate to speak up! I'm here to learn and grow alongside this project, and I value every contribution and piece
of feedback.

Remember: perfect code doesn't exist, but better code does. Let's work together to make Charmer better, one commit at a
time.
